# Project CI Workflow Composition Library.
#   Contains functions which execute the project's high-level continuous integration tasks.
#
# How to use:
#   Update the "workflow compositions" in this file to perform each of the named continuous integration tasks.
#   Add additional workflow functions as needed. Note: Functions must be executed
